- 👋 Hi, I’m @goodsmash
- 👀 I’m interested in well blockchain, I miss the good old meme days of dogecoin when mining and gifting and throwing into exchanges was rad, up until greedy people decided to
destroy decentralized cryptocurrency blockchain projects in the infancy stages, companies like Cryptcy whom had servers held in Miami, FL USA in which there were speedy to trial claims for left over securities, these securities are the true gems.

The various ALT coins in which their currency was immediatelty devalued as soon as these exchanges fell victim to such crimes.

The projects in which real time, and ENERGY, amond many types of equity was used to create many great projects.

It is great to see how far ahead many of us were, keep those ideas flowing vastly, this is way before the open sea.. I hope one day the recovered wallet.dat
holders of various projects come together to re-launch their protocols with governance and respect, and anonymity if a must or request.  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can in this evolving space, blockchain is great, but we need to understand this on a global perspective on how to encourage growth of all
...

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects in which have a long term goal that assists the next waves of humanity ...
- 📫 How to reach me try here or there you will...
