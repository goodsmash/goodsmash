- 👋 Hi, I’m @goodsmash
- 👀 I’m interested in well blockchain, I miss the good old meme days of dogecoin when mining and gifting and throwing into exchanges was rad, up until greedy people decided to
destroy decentralized cryptocurrency blockchain projects in the infancy stages, companies like Cryptcy whom had servers held in Miami, FL USA in which there was claims for left over
securities, these securities are the true gems. The projects in which real time equity was flowing vastly, this is way before the open sea.. I hope one day the recovered wallet.dat
holders of various projects come together to re-launch their protocols with governance and repsect, and anonymity if a must or request.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can in this evolving space, blockchain is great, but we need to understand this on a global perspective on how to encourage growth of all
...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects in which have a long term goal that assists the next waves of humanity ...
- 📫 How to reach me try here or there you will...
